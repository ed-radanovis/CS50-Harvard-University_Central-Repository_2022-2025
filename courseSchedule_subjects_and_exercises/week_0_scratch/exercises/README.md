# CS50 - Class 0: Scratch Activity

## Introduction to Computer Science

### Week 0 – Scratch

Taught by **Dr. David J. Malan, Ph.D.**

<br>

Below is the result of the completed activity:

<br>

> 🎯 Activity Objective :
>
> - Understand the fundamentals of `computer programming` using `visual programming`.
> - Apply programming building blocks: `functions`, `conditionals`, `loops`, and `variables`.
> - Develop `problem-solving skills` through interactive projects.
> - Create an original **_[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)_** project meeting specific requirements.
> - Experience `computational thinking` and `algorithm design` in a visual environment.

<br>

### 🧩 Activity Requirements

- Use at least two sprites, with at least one not being a cat.
- Have at least three scripts in total.
- Include at least one conditional, one loop, and one variable.
- Use at least one custom block that you create (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Project must be more complex than most examples shown in class but can be simpler than _Oscartime_ and _Ivy's Hardest Game_.

### ⚙️ Setup and Execution

- [ ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites :

✔️ - Access to Scratch website at **scratch.mit .edu** .

✔️ - GitHub account for submission (if the requirements are being followed).

<br>

- [x] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended workflow (as per instructions):

```scratch
// Step 1: Visit https://scratch.mit.edu/
// Step 2: Click "Create" to start new project
// Step 3: Add at least two sprites
// Step 4: Implement three scripts using:

when green flag clicked
say [Hello, world!] for (2) seconds

when [space] key pressed
change [score v] by (1)

when I receive [start v]
repeat (10)
  move (10) steps
  if on edge, bounce
end

// Step 5: Create custom block:
define dance (times)
repeat (times)
  turn cw (15) degrees
  wait (0.5) seconds
  turn ccw (15) degrees
  wait (0.5) seconds
end

// Step 6: Test and debug your project
// Step 7: Save project (.sb3 file)
// Step 8: Submit via CS50 submission system
```
