If the list in songs.db represented a listener's top 100 most played songs in 2018, their audio aura could be characterized based on the average energy, valence, and danceability.
Based on calculations:

- Average energy: 0.659
- Average valence: 0.484
- Average danceability: 0.716

This suggests a moderately energetic musical profile with slightly neutral-to-positive valence and high danceability.

However, this method of calculation may not be very representative of the listener because:

1. Aggregate averages hide variation throughout the year (a person may have distinct phases).
2. It does not consider the emotional or situational context of each play.
3. It ignores distinct music genres that may have different meanings to the listener.
4. Only 100 songs may not capture the real diversity of listening habits.

A better approach would be:
- Analyze songs by period (quarters or months).
- Consider the mode (most frequent genre) instead of just numerical averages.
- Include time-of-day and playback context data if available.
